## Data Model Requirements

Based on the CTO phase Q&A, here's what we need to model:

### Entities to Create

{{#each entities}}
**{{this.name}}**
- {{this.description}}
- Fields needed: {{this.fields}}

{{/each}}

### Relationships

{{#each relationships}}
- {{this.from}} → {{this.to}} ({{this.type}})
{{/each}}

## Technical Decisions Context

These decisions were made during the CTO phase and should influence your schema:

{{#if technicalAnswers}}
{{#each technicalAnswers}}
- {{@key}}: {{this}}
{{/each}}
{{/if}}

## Existing Schema (if any)

{{#if existingSchema}}
Here's the current schema to extend or modify:

{{existingSchema}}
{{else}}
[No existing schema - starting fresh]
{{/if}}

## Constitution Rules (if defined)

{{#if constitution}}
Follow these project rules for schema design:
{{constitution}}
{{/if}}

## Your Task

Generate a complete DBML database schema that:
1. Models all required entities and relationships
2. Uses snake_case for tables and columns
3. Includes primary keys (prefer UUID)
4. Adds created_at and updated_at timestamps
5. Defines all relationships with proper cardinality
6. Includes indexes on frequently queried columns
7. Has meaningful table and column documentation
8. Respects any constitution rules or technical constraints

Return a JSON object with the DBML schema, table list, and relationship definitions.
