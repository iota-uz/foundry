## Your Task

1. Scan the above requirements for vague language, missing edge cases, ambiguous flows, and conflicts
2. Identify up to 5 critical ambiguities that should be resolved before technical design
3. For each ambiguity:
   - Specify the type (vague_language, missing_edge_case, ambiguous_flow, conflict)
   - Rate severity (high/medium/low)
   - Generate a clarifying question
   - Suggest 2-4 concrete answers if applicable

Focus on **high-severity** items first - those that would block technical design or create risk if not resolved.

Return your analysis as a JSON object following the schema provided in the system prompt.
