## API Requirements

Based on the CTO phase and business requirements, we need to build these endpoints:

### Required Operations

{{#each endpoints}}
- {{this.name}}: {{this.description}}
  - Type: {{this.type}}
  {{#if this.method}}
  - Method: {{this.method}}
  {{/if}}
  {{#if this.path}}
  - Path: {{this.path}}
  {{/if}}

{{/each}}

## Data Model Context

Here's the database schema these endpoints will work with:

{{#if schema}}
{{schema}}
{{/if}}

## API Design Decisions

These decisions were made during the CTO phase:

{{#if apiAnswers}}
{{#each apiAnswers}}
- {{@key}}: {{this}}
{{/each}}
{{/if}}

## Existing API (if any)

{{#if existingAPI}}
Here's the current API to extend:

{{existingAPI}}
{{/if}}

## Constitution Rules (if defined)

{{#if constitution}}
Follow these project rules for API design:
{{constitution}}
{{/if}}

## Your Task

Generate a complete API specification that:
1. Implements all required operations from above
2. {{#if apiStyle}}Uses {{apiStyle}} style{{/if}}
3. Includes proper request/response schemas
4. Documents all parameters (path, query, body)
5. Specifies authentication requirements
6. Uses appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
7. Includes meaningful documentation and examples
8. Groups related endpoints with tags/namespaces
9. Respects constitution rules and naming conventions

Return the specification as a JSON object with either OpenAPI 3.0 YAML or GraphQL SDL.
