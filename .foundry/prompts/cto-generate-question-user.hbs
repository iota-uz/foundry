## Your Task

Generate ONE clear, technical question for the "{{currentTopic.name}}" topic. The question should:
1. Build on the business requirements established in the CPO phase
2. Reference previous technical decisions where relevant
3. Provide concrete, specific options (3-5 for single choice)
4. Explain the trade-offs between options
5. Be formatted as JSON following the output schema in the system prompt

Consider the impact of this decision on:
- The data model and database design
- API endpoints and contract
- UI components and pages
- Performance and scalability
- Security and compliance

Respond with ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.
