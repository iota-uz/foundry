# Foundry

**Visual workflow builder for AI-powered software development pipelines**

Build, visualize, and execute multi-step AI workflows with a drag-and-drop interface. Foundry combines a React Flow-based visual editor with a powerful FSM execution engine to orchestrate Claude-powered automation pipelines.

---

## Key Features

### 🎨 Visual Workflow Builder

Drag-and-drop workflow construction with React Flow. Connect nodes visually, configure them in real-time, and see your automation pipeline come to life.

### ⚡ FSM-Based Execution

Deterministic state machine execution with checkpoint/resume capability. Pause workflows, inspect state, and resume from any node.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Nodes

Integrate Claude Agent SDK directly into your workflows. Agent nodes can use tools, execute multi-turn conversations, and make intelligent decisions.

### 🔄 Real-Time Visualization

Watch your workflows execute in real-time with animated node states, live logs, and execution progress tracking via Server-Sent Events.

### 📊 Rich Node Library

Pre-built nodes for common operations:
- **Agent** - Claude-powered AI execution with tool access
- **Command** - Shell command execution
- **Slash Command** - Claude Code operations (/commit, /test, etc.)
- **HTTP** - REST API calls
- **LLM** - Direct Claude API calls with structured output
- **Eval** - JavaScript context transformation
- **GitHub Project** - GitHub Projects V2 status updates
- **Git Checkout** - Clone GitHub repositories for workflow execution

### 🔗 GitHub Integration

Dispatch workflows via GitHub Actions, update GitHub Projects, and automate your development pipeline.

### 🔌 MCP Server Support

Connect Agent nodes to Model Context Protocol servers for extended capabilities. Pre-built presets for Playwright (browser automation), Figma (design integration), and Sequential Thinking (reasoning).

### 🐳 Docker Execution

Execute workflows in isolated Docker containers via Railway for improved security, reproducibility, and scalability. Configure custom images per workflow with encrypted environment variables.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/iota-uz/foundry.git
cd foundry

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Set up database
docker compose up -d postgres
bun db:push

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and add your Anthropic API key and DATABASE_URL
```

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
bun dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Your First Workflow

1. **Launch Foundry** - Run `bun dev` and open your browser
2. **Create Workflow** - Click "New Workflow" on the home page
3. **Add Nodes** - Drag nodes from the left sidebar onto the canvas
4. **Connect Nodes** - Draw edges between nodes to define flow
5. **Configure Nodes** - Click nodes to configure in the right panel
6. **Execute** - Click "Run" to start workflow execution
7. **Monitor** - Watch real-time progress in the Execution panel
